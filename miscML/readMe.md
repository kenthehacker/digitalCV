Cleveland homework3 jupyter notebook file:

        This was a homemade ml algorithm it used a regular stochastic gradient descent algorithm and had stopping conditions in case if the algo kept on running
        it took in patient data and returned odds of them having a disease



qq4 file:

        its a basic MNIST handwritten recognition with Tensorflow. I was using it to see the accuracy changes when i apply different numbers of hidden layers and 
        changing the activation functions and etc




option.py file:

        This is just me fooling around with being able to predict option prices. its a very infantile project at the moment. i plan on turning it into a full blown project that i can possible automate trading/aid me in my option trading career in the future
        It uses tensorflow keras. I first cleaned txt files containing historical option prices then i merged all of them together which i then used to train the neural net
        it uses ReLu and Sigmoid activation functions. 
        I gut out a lot of the features since it was overfitting the data and returned a loss of 10^16
