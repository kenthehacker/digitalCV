I am a recent grad at Washington University in Saint Louis. Please check out my LinkedIn
for my up to date information

My curiosity has grown in computer science even after I graduated and I continue to learn
through these projects. I am just about finished with my CNN deep Q learning project.
I plan on learning more about machine learning

After having completed my dqn project, I do plan on taking a break and explore a peculiar 
side of computer science just for a tad "bit" dealing with entanglements...
