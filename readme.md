# Howdie!
I am a recent grad at Washington University in Saint Louis. Please check out my LinkedIn
for my up to date information!

My curiosity has grown in computer science even after I graduated and I continue to learn
through these projects. 

I've posted some of the projects I've done. My most recent project I completed was writing a DQN snake game
I ran into lots of bumps and relied on the Atari paper and discovered I must use target NN and a repplay buffer

Right now, I am learning FPGA development on the lattice Nandland Go board programmed in Verilog
